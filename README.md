# Plum

Plum is a modular toolkit designed to supercharge Rust development, including fully customizable code libraries, graph and vector databases, and a CLI to let you build and publish your own libraries to be used by others.

Plum has two main objectives:

- Speeding up the building process of local Rust projects with fully customizable plugins.
- Fostering the learning process of Rust, especially in the context of building local agents.

Self notes: deleting the CLI package does not affect the workspace Cargo.toml

This project is currently a work in progress. More details soon.
